# Abusive_language_detection using deep learning

Social media trolls have become a prevalent and persistent issue in online communities. People spread fake news and become a cause for oneâ€™s mental condition and low self-esteem. Hence it is necessary to stop the abuse content being posted on social media and other forms of measures to identify and delete the toxic comments and posts. In this project, we aim to detect toxic and abusive comments on social media by accurately extracting and classifying text from images that can be attached to messages sent online.

Building upon the seminal work, as presented in the base paper 'Using Deep Learning to Detect Social Media 'Trolls',' we constructed a deep learning model utilizing Bi directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi LSTM) and Bi directional Gated Recurrent Units (Bi GRU), employing gate mechanisms to regulate information flow within the network. Furthermore, we went beyond our base paper by incorporating BERT, which leverages attention mechanisms to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. This integration of BERT served as an invaluable addition to our project, refining the model's performance and enabling us to achieve superior results.

In our future endeavors, we plan to develop a web plugin that effectively conceals offensive comments on online platforms. This plugin will leverage our existing model to analyze and identify toxic comments in various languages. By doing so, we aim to contribute towards fostering a more positive and respectful online environment.
